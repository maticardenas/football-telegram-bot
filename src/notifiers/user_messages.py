    f"teams or leagues, or when a match was just played. First, you need to subscribe to notifications with /subscribe_to_notifications command, then you will"
    f" be able to check them and their status with /notif_config and don't worry, you can enable/disable them as you please, with /enable_notif_config and /disable_notif_config commands.\n\n"
    f"{Emojis.FOLDED_HANDS.value} Please bear in mind that, even though it's tested, this is a BETA feature released in a basic version, so more improvements will come in the future.\n\n"

    f"Hi! {Emojis.WAVING_HAND.value}\n\n"
    f"We have just released a new functionality that allow you configure the time you get your <strong>daily</strong> notifications!\n\n"
    f"With the World Cup {Emojis.GLOBE.value}{Emojis.TROPHY.value} approaching, you might want to have the tournament configured as your favourite, so automatically every day you will get the "
    f"daily agenda of it :). \n\nUntil now, daily notifications (for matches of favourite teams & leagues) were being informed always at <strong>8:00 am</strong> (time on the main time zone configured for the user). \n\n"
    f"Given time zone differences, sometimes matches happen at a time earlier than that in some user's time zones, like it will happen in the World Cup. "
    f" Therefore, the reason of releasing this new small functionality which allow you to choose the time in the morning you would like to get the daily notifications {Emojis.PARTYING_FACE.value}.\n\n"
    f"{Emojis.RIGHT_FACING_FIST.value} For doing so, a new command was introduced: /set_daily_notif_time. It will display you the times to you, and you can select it accordingly in order to set your desired notification time.\n\n"
    f"Thanks! And hope you enjoy the World Cup! \n\n*And good luck to your national team in case it's participating ;)"

    f"Hi! {Emojis.WAVING_HAND.value}\n\n"
    f"We are pleased to announce that we have released a new improvement which changes the way commands work, making it not necessary to keep and use <em>ids</em> anymore :).\n\n"
    f"All commands have now a <em>search</em> of <em>teams</em> and <em>leagues</em> embedded, so therefore, whenever for example you would like to add a favourite team and look for a next match, you will be able just to call the command and, "
    f"in the form of a conversation (yes, not need to append anything after commands anymore!) enter the (part of) name of the team/league you want and the bot will start showing you a list of the found ones, in the form of "
    f"<strong>BUTTONS!</strong> (doesn't it sound good?). \n\n"
    f"{Emojis.RIGHT_FACING_FIST.value} This means that consequently, you don't need to manipulate the <em>ids</em> anymore, and you can just worry on pressing the commands. Also, "
    f"as <em>search</em> is embedded in all commands now, <em>search_team</em>, <em>search_league</em> and <em>seach_time_zone</em> commands will be deprecated, as they become unnecesary {Emojis.SMILEY_FACE.value}\n\n"
    f"{Emojis.ROBOT.value} This new feature has allowed to think and unblock us in the development of other news in the roadmap, so hold on tight! we are planning to add:\n\n"
    f"‚Ä¢ <strong>Friendly setup</strong> - A handy and guided conversation for starting using the bot, when entering <em>/start</em> command.\n"
    f"‚Ä¢ <strong>Follow players</strong> - Keep track of your favourite player games, stats and news.\n"
    f"‚Ä¢ <strong>Standings and line-ups</strong> - Check how your team is doing in its tournaments, as well as getting line-ups before games\n\n"

    f"You can query you language through /my_language command and change it at any time :)\n\n"
